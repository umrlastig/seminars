The **LASTIG lab** is the French leading lab in **Geographic Information sciences**. The lab covers the complete lifecycle of geospatial data from their capture to their visualisation, including modelling, integration & analysis.

We propose every 2 or 3 months seminars that gather **guest keynotes** and presentations of **lab members/affiliates** on a topic at stake. Both mature and on-going works can be featured to stimulate discussions and introduce new lab projects.

Our seminars are **hybrid, free, open to everyone**, assuming you are preliminarly registered. In case of questions, feel free to reach us at sem-lastig_(at)_ign_(dot)_fr.
