The [**LASTIG lab**](https://www.umr-lastig.fr/) is the French leading lab in **Geographic Information sciences**. The lab covers the complete lifecycle of geospatial data from their capture to their visualisation, including modelling, integration & analysis.

We propose every 2 or 3 months seminars that gather **guest keynotes** and presentations of **lab members/affiliates** on a topic at stake. Both mature and on-going works can be featured to stimulate discussions and introduce new lab projects.

Our seminars are **hybrid, free, open to everyone**, assuming you are preliminarly registered. In case of questions, feel free to reach us at sem-lastig_(at)_ign_(dot)_fr.

# September 12, 2025: _Uncertainty and risks_

The recent years have witnessed a tremedous change of paradigm, with a deluge of multi-modal geospatial data (images, text, in-situ measurements, model outputs, etc.). Each modality comes with its own noise level and uncertainty, which should be quantified for numerous application cases. 
This is all the more true for topics with hig stakes such as infrastructure monitoring, natural hazards or sustainable mobility.
This seminar targets to address both subjects, sometimes interwinned, in order to emphasize the numerous facets of uncertainty and the necessarity of tacking such topics for key environmental use cases.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
